      // Arrays can be filled with comma-separated different "types" as shown above, like [number, string, boolean, object, array]. Arrays can be saved in "variables". Since an array is an "object", it can have properties and methods used with it. (.length "how many items in array", .push() "adds to end of array", .splice() "removes a value from array, using index position and number of values to remove", etc.)

      // "While Loop" = while (condition is true): loop will keep going. When condition is false, loop will stop and move on to next lines of code. (imagine a red "Barrel of Monkeys" toy monkey hook on to a Ferris Wheel and ride it up and over with each loop. :-) "i" = "loop variable", inside () = "loop condition", and inside {} = "loop body",and the "increment step" (needed) alters the variable "i" in value, with an end goal (ends at some point). Without the "increment step" you have an "infinite loop" and that is really bad. Each "pass over the ferris wheel" is called an "iteration". Loops create a scope. (any variable created between the curly brackets of a loop, will only exist inside those curly brackets.)

        console.log(i);

      // "For Loop" is like a shorter version of the "while loop". "For Loop" condition is (1; 2; 3) semi-colon-separated. (1 = "loop variable"; 2 = "loop condition"; 3 = "increment step") Standard loop => for  Non-standard => while. The "=>" here is simply being used like an arrow pointing. (not code) "What is a non-standard example?" (generating random numbers until one that is at least 0.5 would be such an example. It is non-stardard example due to not really having a loop variable that increases every loop, nor does it have have an increment step.)

      for (let index = 0; index <= todoList.length - 1; index++) {
        const value = todoList[index];
        console.log(value);
      }

      // To shorten the code, "index <= todoList.length - 1" can be shortened to "index < todoList.length". You can also shorten it by changing "index" to simply "i" as seen below. "i" = "index".

If this result is unwanted, to avoid this behavior you can create a copy of the "VALUES" in the array using a method called "slice()" instead, which makes a copy of the "values" and point to two different arrays. Added and moved to above.

      //More details about loops.
      // 1. break = exit a loop early
      // 2. continue = skip 1 iteration of loop

      // Let's make a loop that counts from 1 to 10.

        if (i === 3) {

      // If we wanted to skip all numbers divisible by three...
      // if (i % 3 === 0) {
      //   continue;
      // }
      // (if dividing "i" by three leaves a remainder of zero, skip.)

      // Now let's create a while loop to count from 1 to 10, then modify it to skip numbers divisible by three.

      let i = 1;

      while (i <= 10) {

          i++;
          continue;

        console.log(i);
        i++;
      }
      // YOU MUST MANUALLY move the increment step "i++" above "continue;" to avoid creating an infinite loop.

      // How to use loops with functions. Let's wrap the code from above in a function...

        const numsDoubled = [];

        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          const num = nums[i];
          if (num === 0) {
            return numsDoubled; // ends the loop
          }

          numsDoubled.push(num * 2);
        }
        return numsDoubled;
      }
      console.log(doubleArray([1, 1, 3]));
      console.log(doubleArray([2, 2, 5, 0, 5])); // loop stopped at 0.

      // changed the "console.log" to "return" and moved console.logs OUTSIDE of function.

      // if we wanted to stop the loop early if we see the number zero, we add the code above.
