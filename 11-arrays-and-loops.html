      // "While Loop" = while (condition is true): loop will keep going. When condition is false, loop will stop and move on to next lines of code. (imagine a red "Barrel of Monkeys" toy monkey hook on to a Ferris Wheel and ride it up and over with each loop. :-) "i" = "loop variable", inside () = "loop condition", and inside {} = "loop body",and the "increment step" (needed) alters the variable "i" in value, with an end goal (ends at some point). Without the "increment step" you have an "infinite loop" and that is really bad. Each "pass over the ferris wheel" is called an "iteration". Loops create a scope. (any variable created between the curly brackets of a loop, will only exist inside those curly brackets.)

(1 = "loop variable"; 2 = "loop condition"; 3 = "increment step") Standard loop => for  Non-standard => while. The "=>" here is simply being used like an arrow pointing. (not code) "What is a non-standard example?" (generating random numbers until one that is at least 0.5 would be such an example. It is non-stardard example due to not really having a loop variable that increases every loop, nor does it have have an increment step.)

      // To shorten the code, "index <= todoList.length - 1" can be shortened to "index < todoList.length". You can also shorten it by changing "index" to simply "i" as seen below. "i" = "index".
